      It is my earnest desire that the quality health care service are taken
      to the doorsteps of each and every citizen of the country. This can
      only be achieved by producing quality doctors and supporting
      professionals. We are committed to keep abreast with the modern
      developments and advancements in the sphere of medical science. I am
      pleased and proud of having a good number of experienced and qualified
      teachers to ensure and excellent academic atmosphere in the college,
      which is an indispensable precondition to teach the medical students.
      I am much delighted to announce that by the grace of Al-mighty Allah
      MH Samorita Hospital and Medical College has been continuing its
      journey since 2010. This year we are going to admit 11th Batch MBBS
      students, 10th Batch BDS students and 7th Batch Nursing students.

      Samorita Hospital was established about 39 years ago. Then we became
      determined to establish a Medical College and a Hospital maintaining
      the international standard keeping in mind the acute shortage of
      Doctors and Dental Surgeons in Bangladesh. Hence MH Samorita Hospital
      and Medical College was established and later on, we established MH
      Samorita Medical College Dental Unit & Nursing College(BSC & Diploma).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      We are really proud of having a good number of highly qualified and
      renowned teachers in our Medical College & Dental Unit enriching our
      facility and ensuring us a quality teaching learning environment.

      Bangladesh is a densely populated country. The government of
      Bangladesh has never been able to ensure proper medical facilities for
      its total population. A vast number of people of our country are
      deprived of modern medical facilities and hence die of many diseases
      which can easily be prevented and cured. Moreover, the doctors, nurses
      and patients ratio in our country is very poor and alarming in our
      country. With this view, MH Samorita Hospital & Medical College was
      founded in 2010 in the heart of the Dhaka city and after some time MH
      Samorita Nursing College was established to meet up the health care
      service of the people.

      We have a very different motto. Our motto is to develop it as a centre
      of excellence for medical education and medical Science. Many of the
      meritorious students do not get chance to be admitted in Government
      Medical Colleges due to limitation of the seats. Our second objective
      is to provide them with a standard medical education at a lower cost.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Our third objective is to make a trustworthy place for treatment of
      the patients at a minimum cost in comparison with other private
      hospitals in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, we are very much sincere in keeping our promises and also
      expect your sincere cooperation to fulfill our objectives.
    </p>

      We are looking forward to developing one of the best Medical Colleges
      and Hospitals in the country for imparting best education to produce
      the best medical professionals of international standard and to ensure
      quality treatment facilities. To accomplish the mission, we provide
      the students with all types of Modern Logistic supports, such as
      modern academic environment, modern laboratory facilities with
      excellent teachers etc.
