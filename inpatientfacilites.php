                            <p style="color: var(--theme-color3);">One attendant is allowed to stay with the patient in the room after visiting hours (10.30am – 11.30 am and 5.00pm – 7.00 pm). It is mandatory to carry the Attendant Pass issued against each patient at the time of admission. Generally, the attendant should vacate the room/ward when the patient is shifted to SCU/HDU or ICU. However, the attendant may still retain the room, but in this case, the patient will be charged for double occupancy (bed charge + SCU/HDU/ICU charge). This is however, allowed subject to the availability of the rooms.</p>
