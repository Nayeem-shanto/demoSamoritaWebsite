            <ul class="discharge-guide-list-style">
                <li>Your physician will determine when you are well enough to leave the hospital; he will notify this in the “Patient’s Medical Record” and write the discharge order.</li>
                <li>We have dedicated staffs who will coordinate all necessary points for a smooth discharge of a patient. They will meet you and:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide you a copy of the Provisional Bill</li>
                        <li>Help you in arranging transport if required</li>
                        <li>Help with follow-up appointments and take-home medications</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>We are committed to ensure discharge arrangements are completed within two hours after the doctor has visited you and given clearance for you to be discharged. You are advised to plan your departure accordingly.</li>

                <li>Your nurse will inform you when the discharge process is complete and your bill has been prepared.</li>

                <li>Customer Care Executives will inform the patient/patient’s attendant when the final bill is ready and provide the Billing Clearance Slip.</li>

                <li>With the Billing Clearance Slip, the patient attendant will go to the IP Billing Counter (located at Level 4) to settle the bill.</li>

                <li>Billing Department will provide two copies of the final bill and settlement money receipt, of which one copy has to be submitted to the nurse in charge.</li>

                <li>The nurse in charge will then give you the Discharge Summary and Investigation Reports.</li>

                <li>The Floor Doctor/Nurse will explain the Discharge Summary, along with other instructions.</li>

                <li>While waiting, we hope you will take a few moments to complete our Patient Satisfaction Survey, which will be given to you by a staff member.</li>

                <li>Please have your personal belongings ready before leaving hospital and advise the person taking you home to bring the car in front of the hospital.</li>

                <li>In case you require:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wheelchair</li>
                        <li>Stretcher</li>
                        <li>Ambulance service</li>
                    </ul>
                    please inform the Customer Care Executive or Nurse Incharge of your floor.
                </li>

                <li>Please vacate the room at the earliest convenience to allow other patients in need to avail the required facilities.</li>
